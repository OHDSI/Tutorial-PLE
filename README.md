Tutorial-PLE
============

Materials for the population-level estimation tutorial. This workshop is for researchers who want to design and execute causal effect estimation studies for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness using the OHDSI tools. The focus will be on the new-user comparative cohort design using propensity scores.
