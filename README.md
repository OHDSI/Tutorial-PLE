Tutorial-PLE
============

Materials for the population-level estimation tutorial. This workshop is for researchers who want to design and execute causal effect estimation studies for safety surveillance and comparative effectiveness using the OHDSI tools. The focus will be on the new-user comparative cohort design using propensity scores.

## Course Prerequisites

- Thorough understanding of the **OMOP Common Data Model (CDM)** - See the [CDM chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/CommonDataModel.html).
- Thorough understanding of the **OMOP Standardized Vocabularies** - See the [Standardized Vocabularies chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/StandardizedVocabularies.html).
- Thorough understanding of **how to define cohorts using OHDSI's ATLAS** - See the [Defining Cohorts chapter](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/Cohorts.html)
- [Recommended] Ability to program in **R** - There are many R courses available, for example the [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/r-programming).
